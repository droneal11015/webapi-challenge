 Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
    Express can be used to build web applications that are simple and compatible with connect middleware.

 Describe Middleware?
    Functions that get the req and res objects and return the response or call to the next middleware for logging or security.

 Describe a Resource?
    a help reference

 What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
    it can return a string with every GET request.

 How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
    Files hold ports for the server to listen on, partitioning out into specific routes make it easier to manage.
